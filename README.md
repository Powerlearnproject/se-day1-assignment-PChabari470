#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall, changes are difficult to incorporate while in Agile, it is highly flexible.
In waterfall, the stages are requirements. design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance while in Agile the stages arerepeated cyces of planning, design, development and testing. 
Waterfall is best for the following scenarios: medical device development, construction project. Agile methodologies are best for the following scenarios: mobile apps development, software development startups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
1. Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer
1.  Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager
1. Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements - use agile methodologies
2. Tight deaadlines - continuous integration and deployment, time menagement and sprint planning, prioritization of tasks
3. Technical debt - refactoring code regularly, enforce code standards, regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing theindividual components of the system
Integration testing - tests the integration of differentcomponents of the system
System testing - tests the full and integrate dsystem
Acceptance system - tests the  alignment of the user's requirements to the system.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: What is the meaning of lab diagnosis? Improved prompt: Give me the lab diagosis for streptococcus pneumoniae,  explaining the catalase and coagulase test. The seconfd prompt is improved since it has a commond, it is clear and specific.
